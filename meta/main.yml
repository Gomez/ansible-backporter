  synopsis: |
    This is a helper Ansible role which allows you to ensure that Debian
    packages with certain versions are available on your hosts. If requested
    version is not available in currently configured APT repositories (for
    example `wheezy` and `wheezy-backports` from official Debian archives),
    `backporter`, if properly configured, will try to build and install
    required version from `testing` repository.
    
    If successful, newly built backported packages will be uploaded to Ansible
    Controller host which then can make these packages available to the rest of the
    Ansible cluster using `debops.reprepro` role to create and maintain local APT
    repository.
    
    `debops.backporter` role is based on instructions from
    [Simple Backport Creation HOWTO](https://wiki.debian.org/SimpleBackportCreation).
    `rmadison` utility from `devscripts` package is used to check available
    Debian packages, and depends on availability of
    [Debian QA Madison](https://qa.debian.org/madison.php) service.
